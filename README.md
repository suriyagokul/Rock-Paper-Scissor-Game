# Rock Paper Scissor Game

   In a game of rock-paper-scissors between a computer and a user, the objective is for the user to select one of the three available hand gestures (rock, paper, or scissors) and compete against the computer's randomly chosen gesture. Here's a step-by-step description of how the game would typically proceed:

**Displaying the options:** The game interface shows the user the available choices of rock, paper, and scissors, usually represented by images or icons. The user can then select one of these options.

**User selection:** The user makes their choice by clicking or tapping on the corresponding image or icon. For example, they might choose to click on the image of a raised fist to represent rock.

**Computer selection:** Once the user has made their selection, the computer randomly chooses its gesture from the same set of options. The computer's choice is not influenced by the user's selection and is determined purely by chance.

**Determining the winner:** **The game compares the user's and computer's selections according to the rock-paper-scissors rules:**

Rock beats scissors, so if the user chose rock and the computer chose scissors, the user wins.
Scissors beat paper, so if the user chose scissors and the computer chose paper, the user wins.
Paper beats rock, so if the user chose paper and the computer chose rock, the user wins.
If both the user and the computer make the same gesture, it results in a tie.
Declaring the winner: After determining the outcome, the game interface displays the results. If the user wins, it announces that the user is the winner for that round. If the computer wins, it declares the computer as the winner. In the case of a tie, the game might indicate that it's a draw and allow the user to play another round.

**Score tracking:** The game keeps track of the number of wins for both the user and the computer, updating the score accordingly after each round.

**Continuing or ending the game:** The game can be designed to continue until a specific number of rounds have been played or until the user decides to stop. At the end of the game, the final scores are displayed, and the overall winner (user or computer) is announced.
